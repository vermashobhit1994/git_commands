This file has command which can be able to delete the remote repository branch whatever you want to delete

Use below command:
git push -d remotereponame remotebranchname

e.g your remote branch name -> main
    your remote repository name (as checked by git remote -v command ) -> arduinorepo
    git push -d arduinorepo main

    This will delete the remote repository branch with name main.

    Note: If remote branch name is default branch then it can't be able to delete it. 
          For this first you need to change the default remote repository branch to some other (let's say master) and then you can delete it.
